# MacroEconometrics_ESS

Working in progress...

Collection of PS and Notes for MSc level students in a Macroeconometrics course.

I aim to provide a comprehensive beginner guide to this field leveraging my lecture notes, codes and material I have collected during my University studies.

I would like this repository to provide valueable insight to the community and to those interested in the field.
I would also like to contribute to it by adding the most recent developements in the academic literature specifically regarding Bayesian Econometrics, a topic I am discovering while embarking in this learning experience.
